<!-- 
1. What is the purpose of the four arguments of the PerspectiveCamera function?
A: it is the camera attributes, together these define the camera's viewing frustum.
   the 1st is Field of view angle in degree, the angle between the upper and lower sides of the viewing frustum,
                                             which determines what is visible in the visualization;
   the 2nd is aspect ratio of the viewing window, control the proportions of Three.js elements;
   the 3rd is near plane, distance to the near clipping plane along the Z axis,
                          things that are closer than near value won't be rendered;
   the last is far plane, which must be greater than the current value of near plane,
                          distance to the far clipping plane,
                          things that are further than far value won't be rendered.

2. What happens when you increase or decrease the numerical values?
A: 1) Field of view angle: increase -> view angle become wider -> cube become smaller;
                           decrease -> view narrows -> cube become bigger;
   2) aspect ratio: if the aspect ratio changes but the canvas remains unchanged, the rendering will be distorted.
                    increase -> Objects become very narrow;
                    decrease -> Objects become very wide and flat;
   3) near plane: has no impact on the rendered view,
                  if it is too big -> will not able to see the element, because it's been clipped from the scene;
   4) far plane: has no impact on the rendered view,
                 if it is too small -> will also not able to see the element;

3. What is the purpose of the value of camera.position.z?
A: the value represent the distance between the camera and the scene in the z-axis(z=0 plane).

4. What happens when you increase or decrease the value?
A: increase -> camera become closer -> bigger element;
   decrease -> camera become further -> smaller element.

5. What happens when the values of the arguments to renderer.setSize() are changed?
A: change the renderer.setSize() will change the width and size to the area we want to fill up, our screen

6. What is the effect of changing the three arguments of BoxGeometry called in shaderCube()?
A: three arguments of BoxGeometry is:
   1) width -> the length of the edges parallel to the X axis;
   2) height -> the length of the edges parallel to the Y axis;
   3) depth -> the length of the edges parallel to the Z axis;
   changing these will changing the size of the cube.

7. How will you speed up the cuboid’s motion?
A: incerase the incremental values of the mesh.rotation.x and mesh.rotation.y;
   e.g. mesh.rotation.x += 0.03;
        mesh.rotation.y += 0.03;

8. How would you change the cuboid’s colour?
A: Change the value of gl_FragColor set by fragment shader;
   e.g. by set gl_FragColor = vec4(1, 1, 1, 1.0); can set the cuboid’s color to white.
