Aim: Get start with OpenCV and to do some very simple image processing.
1. load an image file into memory and display it in a window using OpenCV.
2. threshold the image and display the result.


4 images:
(1) fundus.tif
This is taken from a set of images used to train and test algorithms for recognising the
effects of diabetes on the retina. The ima of the processing is to identify the blood
vessels.

(2) glaucoma.jpg
This is an image taken from a set used to train ophthalmologists to recognise glaucoma.
The aim of processing is to find the diffuse bright region towards the middle and
the brighter area inside it.

(3) optic nerve head.jpg
This was an image captured by a bespoke device that gives a tightly frames image of the 
optic nerve head. The aim of processing is to find the outlines of the large, slightly 
bright area and the smaller brighter area inside it.

(4) motorway.png
This is an image taken off the internet of a motorway destination sign. Car manufacturers
have deployed systems that read speed limit signs. A next step would be to read these
signs. So the aim would be to find the white text.



To run the file:
$ g++ myOpencv.cpp -o test `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
$ ./test
-> you can change the 'test' to whatever you like.


The image path is obtained by the user input at the terminal.
Once the program checks that the path is valid, 2 windows will be displayed:
1. THRESH_BINARY window with a trackbar and an initial threshold value of 0;
2. THRESH_OTSU window.

Press 'p' or 's' to save the THRESH_BINARY image with the current threshold.
Press Esc to stop and exit the program.

Note: 
All other keys are ignored.
All the file is saved in '.png'.
